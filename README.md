# Level Up: API Adventure

## Instructions
This **optional** LevelUp is an opportunity to put everything you've learned during your time in The Global Tech Experience into practice!

Your task is to build an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that utilizes _at least_ one third party API. Your project should receive data from an API and do something with that data. Aside from that, there are no specific technical requirements for this level up. You will have complete creative ownership over what you build!

In the **Resources** section below, there's a link to a huge list of public APIs you can use in your project. Feel free to select any API from that list. If you have trouble deciding on an API to use, we've also curated a short list of fun API suggestions you can choose from.

## Requirements
1. Build an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that utilizes at least one third party API. 

2. At the top of your `script.js` file you'll notice we've left you an empty multiline comment. When you are ready to submit, create a write-up that's a few sentences or paragraphs in the comment to walk your grader through your project. The main points to discuss are:

	- Which API did you use? Why did you choose that one?
	- How did you interact with the API, technically?
	- What does your project do/how does it work?
	- If you were going to keep coding this project, what would you build next?

_(Note: while all the APIs listed above are public and free to use, some of them require authorization to access. For simplicity we recommend using an API with no "Auth" required. Authorization is used to identify which project is making a call and prevent abuse of the service. If the API you choose requires authorization, the page may mention an API key or refer to "Auth". Follow the steps on the API's website to generate a key and add it to your request URL in the designated place.)_
